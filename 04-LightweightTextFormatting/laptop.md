# About Laptop

A **[laptop computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop)** or **notebook computer**, also known as a **[laptop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop)** or **notebook**, is a small, portable personal computer (PC).

### Types of laptops

 Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid. In some laptops, the screen can be separated from keyboard, and become a tablet.

 ### Laptop hardware

Most of the computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the [keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard), although many modern laptops have a built-in [webcam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam) at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers. Laptops can run on both AC power and rechargable battery packs.
